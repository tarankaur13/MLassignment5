Depending on the type of data you're using and your objectives, PCA and LDA may be used. If you’re working with labeled data and your goal is to find a low-dimensional representation that maximizes class separability, then LDA is probably your best bet. However, if our goal is simply to find a low-dimensional representation that retains as much information as possible or if you’re working with unlabeled data, then PCA might be a better choice
